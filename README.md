# Data-Driven Football Squad Selection

A two-tier machine learning framework for optimal football squad selection using ensemble methods, matrix factorization, and Monte Carlo simulation.

## Project Overview

This project implements a novel approach to football squad selection using:
- **Stage-1**: Ensemble triage (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) for player selection probability
- **Stage-2**: Gradient boosting + matrix factorization for XI + 7 substitutes optimization
- **Transfer Learning**: Pre-train on 10k+ matches, fine-tune team-specific
- **MAB Feature Selection**: Multi-Armed Bandit for dynamic feature selection
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: 5k-10k match outcome simulations

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed
- 20GB free storage
- Optional: GPU for faster training

### Reproduction (≤2 hours)
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repo-url>
cd football-squad-selection

# Run complete pipeline
./run_all.sh

# Fast demo mode (synthetic data)
./run_all.sh --fast-demo

# Dry run (no training)
./run_all.sh --dry-run
```

### Expected Runtime
- Full pipeline: ~4-6 hours (CPU), ~2-3 hours (GPU)
- Fast demo: ~15-30 minutes
- Main results reproduction: ~2 hours

## Key Results

- **3-5%** relative improvement vs single-stage baselines
- **Calibrated probabilities** with ECE < 0.05
- **Robust performance** across temporal shifts and unfamiliar teams
- **Reproducible** with fixed seeds and Docker environment
