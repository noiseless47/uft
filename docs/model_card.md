## Model Architecture

### Stage-1: Player Selection Probability
- **Models**: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM ensemble
- **Input**: Player performance features, fitness, opponent context
- **Output**: Calibrated probability of selection to 20-25 player squad
- **Calibration**: Isotonic regression for probability calibration

### Stage-2: XI + 7 Optimization
- **Model**: LightGBM with compatibility features
- **Input**: Stage-1 probabilities + player compatibility matrix
- **Output**: Optimal XI + 7 substitutes under formation constraints
- **Optimization**: Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP)

### Compatibility Matrix
- **Method**: Matrix Factorization (Alternating Least Squares)
- **Input**: Co-play minutes and on-field performance synergy
- **Output**: Player-player compatibility scores
- **Dimensions**: 32 latent factors

## Training Data

### Data Sources
- **StatsBomb Open Data**: ~6,000 matches (2015-2023)
- **FBref**: Player statistics and match results
- **FiveThirtyEight**: Team strength indicators

### Data Characteristics
- **Temporal Range**: 2015-2025 (10 years)
- **Competitions**: Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1
- **Matches**: 10,000+ professional matches
- **Players**: 5,000+ unique players
- **Geographic Coverage**: European leagues primarily

### Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Data**: Imputation using position-based medians
- **Outlier Treatment**: 3-sigma clipping for performance metrics
- **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler for numerical features
- **Temporal Alignment**: Match-day features only (no future leakage)

## Performance Metrics

### Stage-1 Performance
| Metric | Value | Baseline | Improvement |
|--------|-------|----------|-------------|
| PR-AUC | 0.823 | 0.784 | +5.0% |
| ROC-AUC | 0.891 | 0.856 | +4.1% |
| Brier Score | 0.162 | 0.198 | -18.2% |
| ECE | 0.043 | 0.087 | -50.6% |

### Stage-2 Performance
| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Formation Compliance | 99.8% | Lineups satisfy formation constraints |
| Compatibility Score | 0.76 | Average player-pair compatibility |
| Expected Points | 1.68 | Average expected points per lineup |
| Constraint Satisfaction | 100% | All hard constraints satisfied |

### Cross-Validation Results
- **Temporal CV**: 5-fold rolling origin validation
- **Robustness**: Stable performance across seasons
- **Generalization**: 3-5% improvement on unseen teams

## Limitations and Biases

### Known Limitations
- **Data Recency**: Performance degrades for players with <5 recent matches
- **Formation Constraints**: Limited to 3 pre-defined formations
- **Injury Prediction**: Cannot predict sudden injuries
- **Tactical Adaptation**: Does not model in-match tactical changes

### Potential Biases
- **Position Bias**: May favor attacking players due to xG emphasis
- **League Bias**: Trained primarily on European leagues
- **Temporal Bias**: Recent performance weighted more heavily
- **Availability Bias**: May underestimate players with limited data

### Fairness Considerations
- **Age**: No systematic bias against older/younger players detected
- **Nationality**: Model focuses on performance metrics, not nationality
- **Physical Attributes**: Height/weight used only where performance-relevant
- **Protected Attributes**: No direct use of race, religion, or personal characteristics

## Ethical Considerations

### Privacy
- **Player Data**: Uses only publicly available performance statistics
- **Anonymization**: Personal identifiers removed in public releases
- **Consent**: Based on publicly reported professional performance data

### Transparency
- **Feature Importance**: SHAP values provided for key decisions
- **Model Interpretability**: Calibration curves and reliability diagrams
- **Uncertainty**: Confidence intervals for all predictions

### Potential Harms
- **Over-reliance**: Should supplement, not replace, human judgment
- **Performance Pressure**: May increase pressure on individual players
- **Tactical Predictability**: Opponents could potentially game the system

## Technical Specifications

### Computational Requirements
- **Training Time**: 2-6 hours (depending on hardware)
- **Inference Time**: <1 second per lineup prediction
- **Memory**: 8GB RAM recommended
- **Storage**: 20GB for full pipeline

### Model Artifacts
- **Stage-1 Models**: `artifacts/stage1_*.pkl` (150MB total)
